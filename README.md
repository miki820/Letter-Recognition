different fonts, and each letter in these fonts was randomly distorted.

- Number of attributes: The set has 16 numeric attributes for each letter which represent various statistical and geometric features extracted from images.

- Number of records: 20000 records

  Each letter was presented in different styles and distortions ensures data diversity.
